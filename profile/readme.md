  <h1>E-Agle TRT</h1>
</div>

**E-Agle Trento** is a racing team composed of *more than 70 students*, working
closely together to design, develop and realize innovative prototypes for *the
Formula SAE* competition. We are driven by **passion for cars and engineering**.
Following closely the Formula SAE spirit we work together to solve problems and
share ideas, incentivising "cross-pollination" between different working groups.

Welcome to our software (and sometimes hardware) GitHub organization. Feel free
to look around. 👋
